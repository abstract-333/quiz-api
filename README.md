## ERD:

* This project uses **MySQL**.
* A main **user** table.
* **Role** table that describes the main roles included in this rest api service.
* **Role** has should have three roles, **student**, **supervisor**(_teacher_) and **admin**.
* **User** can be admin when _is_superuser_ column is true.
* **Student** can't be _superuser_.
* **Section** describes how many sections could quiz have, such as IT speciality has three
  sections (Software Engineering, AI, Networks) or hom many sections as you consider is correct.
* **University** table just stores the name of universities.
* **User** has foreign keys from **university** and **section** tables, so every user should belong to university and
  specialized in specific section of the main study, whatever the user is student or supervisor.
* **Question** has questions that are entered by supervisors or admins, but every supervisor can only edit and delete
  own question.
* **Feedback** is provided by other users (**student**, **admin**, **supervisor**), note that user can't add feedback
  to own questions.
* **Rating** table stores the results of **student** in quizzes.
* **Blacklist** has users that intentionally solved many quizzes wrong in order of spamming or leveling down the
  university rank.
* **Blocked_level** describes many blocking levels that student can have.
* **Supervisor** didn't affect the rank of university, so when didn't mean to block him.
* _All_ **questions** couldn't be deleted, user can just prevent them from being used in quizzes, this step is import
  because we can monitor who has good effect on system (user can't delete questions so the effect of his questions will
  be visible forever).
